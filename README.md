# README

This is the SumoCoders mini-framework, it should allow you to build applications without much hassle.

## Authentication

In the default dump there is one user:

* user: accounts@sumocoders.be
* pass: internet

## Layout

The markup uses [Twitter BootStrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap), so it should be pretty easy to extend
it and just have a nice looking application.

### SCSS/Compass

We used the Compass-framework in conjunction with the [Twitter Bootstrap compass-port of vwall](https://github.com/vwall/compass-twitter-bootstrap)
to be able to style everything.

If you want to use compass yourself:

	cd ./core/layout
	compass watch ./
